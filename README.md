# Pytorch-Learning
My personal documentation for upskilling in pytorch and deep learning frameworks in general.

# DataSets
- Training Data
- Test Data
- Validation Data
- Why is it best to split data?
= Creating Dataloaders (train and test)

# Creating models (Neural Networks)
- GPU availability
- Linear
- ReLU
- flatten

# Optimizing models
- Loss functions
- Optimization
- Training models using loss and optimizer
- Backpropagation (Gradient Descent very important)
- testing models using loss to compare model performance vs test dataset

# Training and saving
- Epochs
- Save and load
- classes and model evaluation
